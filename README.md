# **Neo Theme**

**Neo** is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

This theme was initially made for personal use, so it was not designed to be customizable. However, I plan on making the major changes from the default theme optional in the future.

## Recommended Fonts

- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for the interface and text fonts.
- [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) for the monospace font.

## Credit
